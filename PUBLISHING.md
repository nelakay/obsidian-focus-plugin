```

## Step-by-Step Submission Process

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name it `obsidian-focus-plugin` (or similar)
3. Make it **public**
4. Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

### Step 2: Push Your Code

```bash
cd /path/to/obsidian-focus-plugin

# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial release v1.0.0"

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/obsidian-focus-plugin.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Create a Release

1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Click "Releases" → "Create a new release"
3. Click "Choose a tag" → type `1.0.0` → "Create new tag"
4. Release title: `1.0.0`
5. Description: Brief changelog or "Initial release"
6. **Attach these files** (drag and drop):
   - `main.js`
   - `manifest.json`
   - `styles.css`
7. Click "Publish release"

### Step 4: Submit to Community Plugins

1. Go to [obsidian-releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases)
2. Fork the repository
3. Edit `community-plugins.json`
4. Add your plugin entry at the end (maintain alphabetical order by `id`):

```json
{
  "id": "focus-plugin",
  "name": "Focus",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "description": "A visibility firewall for your tasks. Focus on what matters NOW by hiding everything else.",
  "repo": "yourusername/obsidian-focus-plugin"
}
```

5. Commit with message: `Add Focus plugin`
6. Create a Pull Request to `obsidianmd/obsidian-releases`

### Step 5: Wait for Review

The Obsidian team will review your submission. This typically takes:
- **1-2 weeks** for initial review
- They may request changes
- Once approved, your plugin appears in the Community Plugins browser

## Review Criteria

The Obsidian team checks for:

### Code Quality
- No malicious code
- No unnecessary permissions
- Follows Obsidian API best practices
- Doesn't break other plugins

### User Experience
- Clear description
- Working functionality
- Reasonable settings
- Good documentation

### Common Rejection Reasons
- Missing LICENSE file
- Broken functionality
- Duplicate of existing plugin without clear differentiation
- Poor documentation
- Security concerns

## After Approval

### Releasing Updates

1. Update version in `manifest.json` and `package.json`
2. Build: `npm run build`
3. Commit and push changes
4. Create a new GitHub release with the new version tag
5. Attach updated `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`

Users will see the update in Obsidian automatically.

### Version Numbering

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` for bug fixes
- `1.0.0` → `1.1.0` for new features
- `1.0.0` → `2.0.0` for breaking changes
